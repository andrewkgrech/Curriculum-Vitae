<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
    <p>I obtained my certificate of completion of specialist training in anaesthesiology and intensive care in Malta in November 2020. My anaesthetic interests include paediatric anaesthesiology and regional anaesthesia as well as transfer medicine and point-of-care ultrasonography. I also maintain an interest in resuscitation medicine and instruct on European neonatal, paediatric and adult advanced life support courses.
        <br>
        Besides my anaesthesiology experience, I hold postgraduate qualifications in medical education, internal medicine and surgery as well as American fellowship certification in wilderness medicine. I also possess extensive educator experience in civilian, industry and military paramedicine.
        <br>
        I completed a twelve month subspecialty fellowship in paediatric anaesthesia (recognised by the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland) at Sheffield Children’s Hospital in November 2022 followed by further fellowship experience in paediatric critical care retrieval medicine with the North West & North Wales Paediatric Transfer Service (NWTS). I currently work as a tertiary level public service anaesthesiologist in Malta with a mixed adult and paediatric practice including a regular (>75%) commitment to tertiary paediatric anaesthesiology.

            <h4>Anaesthetic registrar rota coordinator – Sheffield Children’s Hospital (2022)</h4>
            Coordinating the anaesthetic registrar rota for a busy tertiary hospital required balancing the diverse educational needs of senior anaesthetic trainees in an equitable manner with a requirement for clinical service provision. Fulfilling this role for several months allowed me to develop and demonstrate skills related to interpersonal communication, negotiation, attention to detail, self-motivation and task management under pressure and to regular deadlines.</li>
        <li>
            <h4>CT1 Anaesthetics (Yorkshire & Humber) interview board member – Health Education England (2022)</h4>
            Serving as an interviewer for the national core anaesthetic trainee recruitment process required me to demonstrate strong listening skills and emotional intelligence, as well as undergo specific training related to diversity and equality in the workplace.</li>
        <li>
            <h4>Edward Jenner Programme – NHS Leadership Academy (2021 – )</h4>
            I am presently finishing this foundation course in clinical leadership aimed at senior clinical staff preparing to assume formal leadership responsibilities at the consultant tier.</li>

            <h4>Paired learning clinical leadership and management development initiative – Sheffield Children’s NHS
Foundation Trust (2021 – 2022)</h4>
            This innovative peer-learning scheme pairs clinicians with managers for reciprocal work experience and exposure via regular shadowing of each other’s roles. My participation includes attending working group meetings on clinical governance, clinical coding, care commissioning and analysis of various key performance indicators amongst others.</li>

It also facilitates and endorses research initiatives underpinning environmental aspects of wilderness medical practice.</li>
        <li>
            <h4>Trainee Member, Sustainability Committee – European Society of Anaesthesiology (2020 – 2021)</h4>
            Roles included collaboration on international strategy to promote, facilitate and implement sustainable practices related to the provision of anaesthetic care across European member states. Reduce, reuse, recycle, rethink and research schemes aimed at drug, device and energy conservation by anaesthesiologists reflect the main aims of the committee.</li>
        <li>
            <h4>National Trainee Representative – Association of Anaesthesiologists of Malta (2019 – 2020)</h4>
            The twelve month term on the committee of this anaesthesiologists association involved representing trainee interests and opinions on a national level and acting as a liaison between aspiring and registered specialists in anaesthesia and intensive care.

<h3>Quality Improvement Experience</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            iPad devices for anxiolysis of paediatric patients receiving general anaesthesia (2023)<br>
            Following my experience as a tertiary paediatric anaesthetist in the UK, I secured and coordinated a corporate donation of two Apple iPad tablet devices to enhance the paediatric anesthesiology service at Mater Dei Hospital in Malta. Loaded with age-appropriate entertainment and games, tablet devices are invaluable tools in reducing the anxiety of paediatric patients receiving inhalational or intravenous induction of general anaesthesia.</li>
        <li>
            Management of a child or young person under 16 years on Adult Intensive Care (2023)<br>
            I served as a reviewer of this comprehensive guideline originated by the North West (England) and North Wales Paediatric Critical Care ODN; the aim was to help optimize standards of care for children admitted to adult intensive care units as part of surge capacity plans in the absence of immediate PICU bed availability.</li>
        <li>
            Paediatric critical care unit sedation guidelines (2022)<br>
            Contributed to updating Sheffield Children’s Hospital paediatric critical care sedation guidelines during my time as a paediatric anaesthetic fellow working on PICU. This involved reviewing literature for various nascent trends in international sedation practices to improve local conformity with best practice recommendations involving sedation, delirium and withdrawal phenomena in paediatric critical care.</li>
        <li>
            Analgosedation protocol for improved quality of MR perfusion scans in slipped capital femoral epiphysis patients (2022)<br>
            Preoperative magnetic resonance perfusion scans of femoral heads in SCFE patients are valuable in surgical planning, prognostication and patient counselling. Images are often degraded by movement artefact owing to discomfort experienced by children undergoing scans. I completed a PDSA cycle involving an analgosedation protocol utilising oral analgesics and intranasal dexmedetomidine to enhance diagnostic quality of perfusion scans in the acute SCFE disease phase.</li>
        <li>
            Post-cardiac arrest prognostication guideline (2021)<br>
            Following the release of updated international guidelines, I contributed to the design of local recommendations for neuroprognostication during intensive care after cardiac arrest in liaision with our neurology services to formulate an integrated pathway for cardiac arrest survivors.</li>
        <li>
            ITU daily patient assessment guideline (2019)<br>
            Part of a three person team involved in development of a daily patient assessment tool for use by more junior medical staff working on our intensive care unit. Final product incorporated into bookmark format for implementation across the main national intensive care unit. This tool is now standard in all intensive care patient files, and was used extensively across multiple ad hoc units during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
